Suppose there is a composite game (more than one sub-game) made up of N sub-games and two players, A and B. Then Sprague-Grundy Theorem says that if both A and B play optimally (i.e., they donâ€™t make any mistakes), then the player starting first is guaranteed to win if the XOR of the grundy numbers of position in each sub-games at the beginning of the game is non-zero. Otherwise, if the XOR evaluates to zero, then player A will lose definitely, no matter what.

We can apply Sprague-Grundy Theorem in any impartial game and solve it. The basic steps are listed as follows:

    Break the composite game into sub-games.
    Then for each sub-game, calculate the Grundy Number at that position.
    Then calculate the XOR of all the calculated Grundy Numbers.
    If the XOR value is non-zero, then the player who is going to make the turn (First Player) will win else he is destined to lose, no matter what.

In this case, for each forest:
Gn(0) = 0 by definition
Gn(1) = Mex(Gn(0)) = Mex(0) = 1
Gn(2) = Mex(Gn(1)) = Mex(1) = 0
Gn(3) = Mex(Gn(0),Gn(2)) = Mex(0,1) = 2
Gn(4) = Mex(Gn(0),Gn(3)) = Mex(0,2) = 1
Gn(5) = Mex(Gn(0),Gn(4)) = Mex(0,1) = 2
Gn(6) = Mex(Gn(0),Gn(5)) = Mex(0,2) = 1
-> for each forest (with more than two leaves) XOR by 1 if even number trees and by 2 if odd
